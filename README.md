# SolderPackager 
Version 1.0, built with .NET Core and C#

## How to use
* Download the version to your operating system (Mac or Windows)
* Extract and double-click the application (*StormPackager.exe on Windows; StormPackager on Mac*)
* Follow the on-screen instructions!

## Info
This program creates a folder called **solderzips** and tries to organize the mods.
If it can't, it will be dropped on the root directory of the solderzips folder.
You can drag and drop the exported folders onto your FTP server, however, configuration is not exported with this program *(yet?)*. I would recommend you zip all the configuration and drop it. Probably an option that will be included on the next version
